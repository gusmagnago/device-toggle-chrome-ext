# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy outlines the data practices for our extension. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about our data usage.

---

### 1. Data Collection

- **Active Tab Access:**  
  Our extension temporarily interacts with the currently active browser tab to enable device emulation functionality. This access is granted only while you are actively using the extension.

- **Debugger Usage:**  
  The extension uses the Chrome Debugger API to simulate mobile and desktop device behaviors. This interaction is limited to the active tab and does not access or modify sensitive data.

---

### 2. Use of Data

- **Active Tab Access:**

  - Used exclusively to perform the toggle device functionality within the extension (e.g., switching between desktop and mobile views).
  - No identifiable data, such as tab URLs or tab content, is stored, transmitted, or shared.

- **Debugger:**
  - Used to emulate the mobile and desktop device environments.
  - The debugger is detached immediately after completing the emulation.
  - It does not access or alter personal data or content in the active tab.

---

### 3. Data Protection

- The extension does not collect, store, or share any tab information beyond the temporary scope required for the toggle functionality.
- The debugger access is temporary and only active while the extension is in use. It is detached automatically once the toggle operation is complete.
- No data accessed by the extension is shared with third parties or retained after its immediate use.

---

### 4. Changes to the Policy

- Any updates or changes to this privacy policy will be communicated to you through the extension.
- We encourage you to review the policy periodically to stay informed about how we use your data.
