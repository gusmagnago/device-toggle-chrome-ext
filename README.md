# Device toggle

### Description:

This project provides a simple switch to toggle between Desktop (larger viewports) and Mobile (375x600) views in a Chrome extension. Designed for users who do not intend to utilize other devtools functionalities, it offers a straightforward approach to device emulation without the complexity of full developer tools. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and styled using Material-UI with custom overrides, the extension simplifies the user experience for those seeking just the device toggle feature.

### Project Purpose:
